I18N:
=====
Please note that this project was created with the assumption that it will be run
in an environment where the default locale is set to English. This means that
the default messages defined in package.properties are in English. If the default
locale for your server is different, then rename package.properties to package_en.properties
and create a new package.properties with proper values for your default locale.
