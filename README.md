This Maven multi-module project contains all the Struts 2 example applications that are part of the Getting Started Struts 2 tutorials at http://struts.apache.org.

To build all the example applications run the Maven command:

```
mvn -e clean package
```

In the project's root folder, Maven will build each module and create a `.war` file in the target sub-folder of each module.

You can then copy the `.war` files to your Servlet container (e.g. Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish, etc).

There is a README file in each module with instructions and the URL to view that application.
